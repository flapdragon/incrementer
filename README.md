# Incrementer
A man in Florida that could have been Guy Fieri's brother once said he uses the same app to learn new technologies. The idea being the requirements stay the same so the new technology is easier to focus on. Then I heard Stephen Grider do it and I was hooked. I'm using SG's simple incrementer for my class. This project will contain each implementation in their own folders.

It is intended for my lectures but anyone is free to use it. As each technology is used there will be default starter kits, especially for ones that have multiple choices, such as state for React.
